Step 4. Remove the battery from its cutout and either using your fingers or the pliers VERY GENTLY pull out the battery pin. Only grip the pin by the two thinnest sides of the white plug and gently wiggle back and forth to ease the plug out. **Do not pull on the wires or squeese the plug too tightly with the pliers**
