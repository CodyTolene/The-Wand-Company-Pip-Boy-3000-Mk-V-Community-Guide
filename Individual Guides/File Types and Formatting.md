# File Types and Formatting

## Introduction

Your wand company Pip-boy uses two primary file types to cover the vast majority of media. Video files are AVI while audio typically uses WAV. By creating files in these two specific formats we can add or replace files within the pip-boy, for example we can replace the audio files in the radio folder with our own custom files, allowing us to add our own music without using the custom radio app. We can also add custom AVI files to play in certain tabs including the maps section. In this guide will be a breakdown of each of these two file types and tools you can use to both convert and upload the files to your device.

## Formats

### **Video:** AVI file set at 12fps with an aspect ratio of 408x248px
### **Audio** WAV file in 16bit Mono

## Community Converter (Windows)
### We have a premade .exe tool based on FFMPEG created by @codytolene right [here](https://github.com/CodyTolene/pip-boy-3000-mk-v-media-converter.git) on github. The application can be installed and used by following the instructions on its repository. Alternatively you can follow the guide below to download FFMPEG directly and use it in your shell (terminal)
