# Painting and Weathering your device
One of the many ways you can customise your device is to remove the weathering and optionally repaint the device altogether. In this short guide we will cover the few stages to attempt this and show off an example. Because of how its applied the stock weathering will probably rub off over time, particularly in areas that are handled a lot, so you may wish eventually to reapply it. At the bottom of this guide ill add a small section on how to do that.

## Removing the stock weathering
The Pip-boy comes with a layer of black "grime" added around the device to give an illusion of the device having been through a wasteland. This applied effect we think is watered down acyrlic paint, it can be removed very easily. To remove it simply use a clean lint-free cloth and some rubbing alcohol, you could also in theory even use vodka or gin. **Whatever you do do not use acetone or paint thinners as they may strip the silver paint from the abs plastic body.** Heres an example of a Pip-boy thats had its weathering removed:

## Adding custom weathering
I asked a member of our community S15Costuming about the process they used to weather their device and they kindly provided us with pictures and a description of the process:

**"First, I cleaned up the stock weathering that The Wand Company used with Rubbing Alcohol, then I used acrylic paints, mainly from Vallejo's Rust, Stain, and Streaking kit to start weathering and staining, trying to focus on spots that would be rusted the most, such as areas where water, dirt, and grime would gather. I also used a mix of watered down acrylic paints to "dirty up" the screen, mainly focusing on the edges of the screen. I used rubbing alcohol and water to thin it out to make it not look like I just threw down blotches of paint. I had to keep cleaning and reapplying paint to get it to a state where I was happy with the weathering."**

## Completely repainting the device (full coverage)
You can if you wish completely repaint the outer shell of the device. In order to do this youll need to use masking tape to cover anywhere you dont want to repaint and remove the cushions, make sure you dont forget to mask off the cable too. Once you're ready youll want to cover the entire shell with an even coat or two of a primer, followed by a coat or two of your colour of choice. If you have a dual primer and colour spray that might work too. Spray paint is definitely reccomended here for even coverage a brush would struggle to achieve.

## Reapplying the stock weathering
Even if you dont want to completely repaint or weather yout device you may want to add back some of the stock weathering. To achieve this you can water down black acrylic in a 2:1 paint to water ratio (possibly thicker like a 3:1 if you want more persistent grime) and brush some on. Make sure you keep water away from the dials and buttons and once the paint has been on for about 10-20 seconds use some tissue or a paper towel to wipe some of it off. You can also just brush the paint and water mix into the nooks and crannies around the body and leave it overnight to dry.
