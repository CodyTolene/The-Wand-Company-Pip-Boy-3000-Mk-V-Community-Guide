# Custom Maps and Dithering

## Custom Map app

The custom map app hosted [here][pip-boy-website] on our tie-in website allows
the upload of custom map images to your device to replace the stock map
animations with a scrollable map similar to the one in the games, For a tutorial
on app installation please go **LINK GOES HERE**. The app was created by the
wand company and issued with their official app loading tool, the basis of which
cody built our own website around. Below is a tutorial on how to prepare images
for the app and a link to some pre-prepared maps made by EpicestGamer and
Azrael.

#### **All Images Uploaded should be 2048x2048 in Size for Maximum Compatibility**

## Dithering

Dithering an image involves adding texture to helps limited colour screens show
more depth of shade by strategically placing pixels next to each other at
different brightnesses to simulate a gradient. This may not be needed entirely
but most maps we uploaded required this step to ensure detail like roads and
icons remained clear.

### Windows (provided by EpicestGamer)

To dither on a windows pc download the [Paint.net][paint-net] tool an and its
optional (but needed here) [plugin][paint-dither-plugin] Once both are installed
open the image you wish to use within and follow these steps:

First ensure your image is correctly sized
<img width="290" height="428" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7c32858-341f-4805-80de-3c7094f4fa50" />
Next apply the effect within the menu

Lastly select your dither pattern and bit size. We recommend these settings or
floydsteinberg but you can play around with it and see what works.

### Mac (also works on windows as an alternative)

Download and install the [Krita][krita-link] software and get it ready to run.
Once your'e ready follow these steps:

Open your image in Krita and check again its sized correctly (if not like seen
here it may still work, Try at your own discretion)

Next open the G-Mic_qt menu in filters
<img width="1440" height="900" alt="Screenshot - Krita18September2025 2@2x" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32fe23c3-5930-434d-a9e9-708a22e926c7" />
lastly select the Dither srgb option and choose a level. Like with the windows
settings you can play around here and see what works best. There are also other
dither types here within this menu you can experiment with.
<img width="1440" height="900" alt="Screenshot - Krita18September2025 3@2x" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3a5eaa5-97c8-4cb4-ba93-e85db511db4d" />

#### Once you have your dithered image you can upload it to the custom map app on the website.
