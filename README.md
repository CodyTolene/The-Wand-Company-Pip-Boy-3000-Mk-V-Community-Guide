## Credits

### [Azrael][azrael-website]

Creator of this repository and learning as I go.

### [Cody Tolene][cody-tolene-website]

Cody has created a vast array of tools and is responsible for a large portion of
our understanding of the device. From creating the Pip-Boy website and several
of its apps to troubleshooting known issues and finding fixes. There would be
none of this without him. He is also the founder of our community Discord group
and has contributed an unbelievable amount of time and personal resources to the
various sites.

### [Darrian][robco-industries-website]

Darrian like Cody has been a huge contributor to the community understanding of
the Pip-Boy. His website has many great articles detailing the internal workings
of the device as well as other fun Fallout-themed builds and teardowns. Most of
what I'm able to write here about the inner workings of the device or the
firmware I learned from him.

### [Athene][athene-website]

Athene has been contributing to the Pip-Boy community since the beginning. She's
responsible for the original community color picker for the interface and has
been heavily contributing to other apps and projects.

### [Eckserah][eckserah-website]

Eckserah has been a strong contributor to both our troubleshooting section as
well as solving some of the known issues. Their advice and accompanying photos
have been a useful addition to the guide.

### [EpicestGamer][epicestgamer-website]

EpicestGamer has kindly provided a tutorial for image dithering as well as most
of our pre-dithered map images ready for upload. They have also provided
high-quality scans of the Pip-Boy's packaging.

### [S15 Costuming][s15costuming-website]

S15 Costuming has written a section for us on painting and weathering our
devices, their own success is profound and during a livestream and showed the
whole process and recorded many great pictures for us to use as reference. If
you're planning to paint or alter the weathering on your Pip-Boy I highly
recommend you check the section on weathering and paint linked above.

### [Theeohn][theeohn-youtube]

Theeohn has been helping test and troubleshoot issues with the device and build
our FAQ and known issues, he's also provided photos for the weathering section.

### [Homicidal mailman](/#) <!-- No link, use a placeholder for now. -->

Provided backups for versions of the OS and its update files on Discord

### [The Wand Company][the-wand-company]

While not directly contributing to the community effort we still need to take a
moment to appreciate the main team behind this device. Not only have they given
us an incredible and well-thought-out piece of kit to mod they also continue to
support with firmware updates and advice for all who contact them with issues.
They created the app loading platform we currently use as the foundation for our
own site as well as at least three of the apps listed there. A couple of our
modders have even had the chance to speak to members of The Wand Company team
and by all accounts they're kind and generous and passionate about this
wonderful device. One such member Chris Barnardo has created a fundraiser for
Type 1 Diabetes so if you wish to contribute to this project or support them a
donation to that would be greatly appreciated. The link is [here][twc-donation]
